This is my will. I am Maria Guadalupe Hernandez and I live in Albuquerque.

I am writing this myself on August 30, 2023 because I want to make sure my wishes are known.

I leave my house at 567 Rio Grande Boulevard to my daughter Isabel.

I leave my three restaurants to be divided equally between my children Isabel Hernandez-Montoya, Miguel Angel Hernandez, and Sofia Hernandez.

I want my son Miguel to have my 2020 Ford F-150 truck.

The rental houses on Central Avenue should be sold and the money divided between all three children.

I name my brother Juan Hernandez to handle my estate.

This is my signature:

Maria G. Hernandez
August 30, 2023

Written entirely in my own handwriting at my home in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
