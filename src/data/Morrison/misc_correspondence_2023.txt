Re: Proposed Fence Installation - 569 Maple Grove Road

Dear Commission Members,

I am writing to inform you of my intention to install a 6-foot wooden privacy fence along the eastern property line of my residence at 569 Maple Grove Road. This fence will run approximately 150 feet from the rear corner of my house to the back property line.

The fence is necessary due to:
- Increased traffic noise from Route 35
- Privacy concerns
- Safety for my two dogs

I have discussed this with my immediate neighbor at 567 Maple Grove Road, and they have no objections. The fence will be constructed of natural cedar and will comply with all town regulations.

Enclosed please find:
- Property survey showing proposed fence location
- Contractor estimate from Ridgefield Fence Company
- Neighbor acknowledgment form

I would appreciate your review and approval of this application. Please contact me if you need any additional information.

Sincerely,

Eleanor G. Williams
