Subject: Paradise Valley Residence - Final Plans

Team,

Following up on our meeting last week regarding the Paradise Valley project at 789 University Drive. Please note this is actually going to be built in Tempe, not Paradise Valley as originally discussed. My apologies for the confusion.

Key changes to incorporate:
1. Solar panel array on south-facing roof (required by new city ordinance)
2. Expanded garage to accommodate electric vehicle charging station
3. Desert landscaping per HOA requirements
4. Pool house to include kitchenette

The client (purchaser of the lot from Chen Healthcare Management) wants to break ground by November. Budget has increased to $1.2M for construction.

Also, please update the plans to show the correct lot dimensions: 150' x 200' (not the 125' x 175' shown on current drawings).

Can we schedule a final review for next Tuesday at 2pm?

Best,
Jennifer
