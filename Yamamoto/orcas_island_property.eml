Hi Alex,

Great news! The closing documents for your Orcas Island vacation home are ready for review. The sellers have agreed to all our terms, including the early possession date.

Property Details Reminder:
- Address: 234 Sunset Beach Road, Eastsound, WA 98245
- Purchase Price: $1,850,000
- Closing Date: September 29, 2023
- Possession: September 25, 2023 (early possession agreed)

Included Features:
- 3,200 sq ft main house
- 800 sq ft guest cottage
- 180 feet of waterfront
- Deep water dock with boat lift
- All furniture and artwork (as per inventory list)

The title report came back clean, and the septic inspection passed. The only item noted was the need to trim trees near the power lines, which the seller will complete before closing.

I've scheduled the final walkthrough for September 24th at 2 PM. Can you make it over on the 11:45 AM ferry from Anacortes?

Also, regarding your question about short-term rental regulations - San Juan County does allow vacation rentals, but you'll need to apply for a permit. I can connect you with a property management company that handles all the permitting and operations if you're interested.

The wire instructions for closing are:
First American Title
Account: 789456123
Routing: 125000024
Reference: Escrow #2023-4567

Please confirm the wire 24 hours before closing.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best,
